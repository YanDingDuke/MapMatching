# MapMatching
It is just a brief description about this project.

Map matching is an essential pre-process for many LBS applications, which is to project a GPS point 
to an edge in a road network.   

There are many famous methods, for example ST-matching. 

Though ST-matching is a good method, it will cost many time to perform the temporal analysis 
which need to find the shortest route. 

In this project, I will give two code versions. 

In the first version, I abandon the temporal analysis, only use the spatial analysis, which is an aggressive version 
and may correspond to lower accuracy but less time. 

The second verson is complete one, which I will use the temporal anaysis in.
